        <h2>Mountains</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Mountains are majestic landforms that rise high 
            above the surrounding landscape. They are formed by the
             movement and collision of tectonic plates, and their peaks 
             can reach heights of several thousand meters. Mountains are 
             home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, and they provide 
             important ecosystem services such as water regulation and carbon
              sequestration. They also offer opportunities for recreation and
               tourism, including hiking, skiing, and mountaineering. However, 
               mountains are also vulnerable to human activities such as 
               deforestation, mining, and tourism development, which can
             have negative impacts on their fragile ecosystems.</p>
             <h3>Types of Mountain</h3>
             <p>There are three main types of mountains:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fold Mountains:</strong> These are mountains that are formed by the folding of rock layers due to tectonic plate movements. Examples include the Himalayas, the Alps, and the Andes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault-Block Mountains:</strong> These are mountains that are formed when large blocks of the earth's crust are uplifted and tilted along fault lines. Examples include the Sierra Nevada in the United States and the Harz Mountains in Germany.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volcanic Mountains:</strong> These are mountains that are formed by volcanic activity, either by the eruption of lava and ash or the accumulation of volcanic material over time. Examples include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, and Mount St. Helens in the United States.</li>
                </ul>


            </p>
            <h3>5 Highest Mountains</h3>
            <p>The top 5 highest mountains in the world, based on their elevation above sea level, are:

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Mount Everest</b> - 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) - located on the border between Nepal and Tibet.</li>
                    <li><b>K2</b> (also known as Mount Godwin-Austen) - 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) - located on the border between Pakistan and China.</li>
                    <li><b>Kangchenjunga</b> - 8,586 meters (28,169 feet) - located on the border between Nepal and India.</li>
                    <li><b>Lhotse</b> - 8,516 meters (27,940 feet) - located on the border between Nepal and Tibet, next to Mount Everest.</li>
                    <li><b>Makalu</b> - 8,485 meters (27,838 feet) - located on the border between Nepal and Tibet.</li>
                </ol>
                Note that these elevations are based on the latest measurements available and may be subject to slight changes over time due to natural factors such as erosion and tectonic activity.</p>
